# XandicLifehub - Hotel Management Console Application

Hotel Xandic is developing a new hotel management software in C++ due to delays in their current system and hearing that C++ is known for its speed.

## Task
Your task is to create an interactive program where users can create and log in to their profiles in XandicLifehub. The profile should allow users to:

- View available reservations.
- Book new reservations.
- View a history of previous bookings.
- Cancel reservations.
- Delete their profiles according to GDPR regulations.

## Persistent Data

The data should be persistent, and you can use a simple text file to store it. C++ makes this easy with `fstream`. You can refer to [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/) for more information on working with files in C++. For an extra challenge, consider saving the data as a CSV file; you can find tips on this in the [GeeksforGeeks CSV file management tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/csv-file-management-using-c/).

## Future Development

Bring your solution to the upcoming meeting. We will discuss our solutions in smaller groups and try to come up with a "better" common solution. Later on, we will rewrite the program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Until then, it's perfectly fine to primarily focus on implementing the core functionality of the program.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the XandicLifehub application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xandic-lifehub.git
